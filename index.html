			<p>Cryptocurrency is like a digital form of cash. You can use it to pay your friends your share when going to a restaurant, buy that new pair of socks you've been eyeing üëÄ, or book flights ‚úàÔ∏è and hotels üè® for your next vacation. Since cryptocurrency is digital, it can also be sent to friends and family anywhere in the world.</p>

			<p>Like PayPal or bank transfers, right?
			<p>No, not exactly. This way is more interesting!
			The thing is that traditional online payment gateways are owned by organizations. They hold your money for you and you need to make a request to transfer funds on your behalf when you need to spend it.</p>

			<p>In cryptocurrency, there is no organization. You, your friends and thousands of other users can act as your own banks using free software. Your computer connects to other people's computers, meaning you communicate directly - no intermediaries needed!</p>

			<p>To use cryptocurrency, you do not need to register on a website with an email and password. You can download various applications on your smartphone to start sending and receiving cryptocurrency in minutes.</p>
